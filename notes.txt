I'm an idiot. It's been a while since I used mmdebstrap to create something
other than a tarball and forgot that it won't work on directories that are
already populated. Obviously, this causes an issue with creating and mounting
partitions before the system is installed (and any system booting in EFI mode
requires a boot partition to be mounted to the /mnt/boot/efi directory at
install time).

I wanted to take advantage of mmdebstrap's hooks for the installer, but since
it won't work I'll go back to my original idea of creating a small rootfs (with
mmdebstrap) that would get extracted at install time, rather than using the
tool directly.

This was a smarter plan, as it would make the install process faster, and
put less strain on the repos' monthly download limits. My concern lies
solely with proper permissions once the tarball is extracted. Using the
right tar arguments will avoid any issues, but I'm paranoid so there
you go.

This paranoia will be moot once the 'security-check' cron job is created, as
it will check for proper file permissions and fix any problem in that regard,
among other things.
